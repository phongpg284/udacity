For this problem, we only need to implement a single linked list and modify to `add_block()` where the new block get `previous_hash` = `hash` of tail block 

With linked list implement, complexity will be O(1) for `add_block()`

----------------------------------------------------------------------

For one linkedlist, space complexity will be O(n) given n is number of blocks.
